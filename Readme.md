# `geo-cli`
A tool that makes MyGeotab development easier. Specifically, this tool aims to simplify cross-release development by managing various versions of `geotabdemo` Postgres database containers. This allows you to easily switch between release branches without having to worry about database compatibility. In the future, it also aims to simplify other pain points of development by automating them; providing an easy-to-use interface that hides the complexity under the hood.

> `geo-cli` is currently under active development and is updated often. Please contact me on Chat or through email (dawsonmyers@geotab.com) if you have a feature idea or would like to report a bug.

> `geo-cli` is only supported on Ubuntu. However, it can be made to work in WSL on Windows if you set up docker for it.
